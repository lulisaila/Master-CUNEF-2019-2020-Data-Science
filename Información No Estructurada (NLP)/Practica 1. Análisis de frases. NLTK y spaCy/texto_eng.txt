Cuomo of New York said that 731 more people had died in the state from the coronavirus, the largest single-day increase since the crisis began. The state’s total reported death toll from the virus is 5,489. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Tuesday that 731 more people had died in the state, the largest single-day increase in deaths from the coronavirus since the crisis began. The grim tally followed two days in which the numbers appeared to have leveled off. The total number of deaths is 5,489. The governor emphasized that the death rate was a lagging indicator, and pointed to a falling rate of hospitalizations. He also  said that the state was still projecting that the spread of the virus was plateauing. Mr. Cuomo said that increases in hospital beds and the number of health care providers who were working had helped New York to balance its patient load and help ensure that no one facility was overburdened. The number of hospitalizations depends not only on the number of new arrivals but also on hospital admission standards. As hospitals have teetered on the brink of being overwhelmed, they have sent home people whom they would have admitted just a few weeks earlier, several New York doctors said in interviews.
